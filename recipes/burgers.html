            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Blue cheese burgers aren't just basic hamburgers â€” they're a real treat, and the wise cook will make up a dozen or so for the freezer. If you like blue cheese, you'll never forget these burgers.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 pounds lean ground beef</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup minced fresh chives</li>
                    <li>4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
                    <li>12 hamburger buns, split</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix ground beef, chives, blue cheese, salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, mustard, and hot pepper sauce together in a large bowl until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                    <li>Remove beef mixture from the refrigerator; form into 12 patties.</li>
                    <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 5 minutes per side. Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
